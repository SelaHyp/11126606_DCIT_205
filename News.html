                     <h1>Advanced Augmented Reality</h1>
                      <p><b>AR</b> can combine real-life and computer-generated content enhancement. It has the option of optical projection systems and display systems.
                        Similar to the rise of Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality is also becoming a new 
                        technology trend.<br /><br />
                        In 2020, research estimated 83.1 million American monthly users of advanced AR. Most of these numbers were from the education sector. Americans saw how this trend can enhance the student's learning experiences.<br /><br />

                        The significant growth of AR led to many developments that brought entertainment and education. If you are wondering if you have used one of these, check out some examples of Advanced Augmented Reality:<br /><br /> 
                        <b>Google Street View</b> - Google offers many features, including digital maps. This AR can help you in moving further in a certain direction. Users can also zoom in and see the streets live using their smartphones. <br /><br /> 
                        <b>Snapchat</b> - This app lets people impose filters on their faces as it digitally overlays on the users. These filters can look real when applied.<br />

                     <h1>Fake Google Chrome and Safari updates</h1>
                     Fake Google Chrome and Safari updates for macOS are being used to infect Mac computers with the nefarious Atomic Stealer malware, also known as AMOS.
                     Distributed to Mac owners as part of a social engineering campaign,<b>AMOS</b> can steal passwords, private files stored on a Mac. Users will need to stay alert and
                    possibly use web protection tools in order to protect themselves from malware distributed by social engineering, as malware creators appear to be turning their attention to Mac owners.<br /><br />
                    Security firm Malwarebytes shared details of the latest version of Atomic Stealer, malware that is distributed to macOS users via ClearFake,
                    a campaign that uses hijacked WordPress websites to deliver fake browser updates for Chrome and Safari. The distribution of AMOS via ClearFake to macOS users was recently spotted by Ankit Anubhav,
                     a security researcher.<br /><br />
                    <b>In order to stay protected from the malware</b>, users will have to make sure they use some form of web protection 
                    — such as the Safe Browsing setting inside Google Chrome. Doing so might block some of these malicious sites from loading altogether.
