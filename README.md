## LESSON LEARNT
        From the I practically learnt the syntax and the methods to the use of tags and elements in html.
        To be precise in html decovered and learnt new tags like the <link>,<section>, creating number, bulleted list using the <ul>,<li>,<ol> tags and practically everything I represented on the webpage.
        In Css I was able the effectively make use of the hover, after, and before effects, the color codes like #fff is white #f5f5f5 is gray etc, 
        Combining both i was able to come up with a responsitive header,footer and shadows box several others.
        I am proud to say the experience was impactful and it has given me the confidence and stepping stone to move forward.

  Feel free to give any recommendations, adding, or critisims about the project. THANK YOU.
